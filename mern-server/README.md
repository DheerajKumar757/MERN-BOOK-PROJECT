The code snippet at line 62:

```javascript
const updateDoc = {
  $set: {
    ...updateBookData
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
This code is preparing an **update document** for a MongoDB `updateOne` or `updateMany` operation. It specifies how the fields of a document in the database should be updated.

#### Breakdown:
1. **[`$set`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A62%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition")**:
   - [`$set`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A62%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") is a MongoDB update operator.
   - It is used to update specific fields in a document. If a field does not exist, it will be created.
   - Example: `{ $set: { fieldName: newValue } }`

2. **`...updateBookData`**:
   - The spread operator (`...`) is used to copy all the properties of the [`updateBookData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") object into the [`$set`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A62%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") object.
   - This means all key-value pairs in [`updateBookData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") will be included in the update.

3. **[`updateDoc`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A61%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition")**:
   - This is the final object that will be passed to the MongoDB `updateOne` or `updateMany` method to perform the update.

### Example in Context:
If [`updateBookData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") contains:
```javascript
const updateBookData = {
  title: "New Book Title",
  author: "Updated Author"
};
```

The [`updateDoc`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A61%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") will look like:
```javascript
const updateDoc = {
  $set: {
    title: "New Book Title",
    author: "Updated Author"
  }
};
```

This tells MongoDB to update the `title` and `author` fields of the matching document(s) with the new values.

### Usage in MongoDB Update:
This [`updateDoc`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A61%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") would typically be used in a MongoDB update operation, such as:
```javascript
const result = await booksCollection.updateOne({ _id

:

 bookId }, updateDoc);
```

Here:
- `{ _id: bookId }` is the filter to find the document to update.
- [`updateDoc`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A61%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") specifies the fields to update.

### Summary:
The code dynamically creates an update document using the [`$set`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A62%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") operator and the properties of [`updateBookData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition"). It ensures that only the fields specified in [`updateBookData`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e3de33e1-8107-4c21-b330-367f527103f6%22%5D "Go to definition") are updated in the database.




You should use [`await`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A35%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%228ca9ee84-f1ec-475d-8834-53d4bf13dd1a%22%5D "Go to definition") in the **second line**:

```javascript
const books = booksCollections.find(); // No await here
const result = await books.toArray();  // Use await here
```

### Explanation:
1. **[`booksCollections.find()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A38%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%7D%5D%2C%228ca9ee84-f1ec-475d-8834-53d4bf13dd1a%22%5D "Go to definition")**:
   - This method returns a **cursor** immediately, which is a pointer to the query results. It does not require [`await`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A35%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%228ca9ee84-f1ec-475d-8834-53d4bf13dd1a%22%5D "Go to definition") because it does not perform the actual data retrieval yet.

2. **[`books.toArray()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A49%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%228ca9ee84-f1ec-475d-8834-53d4bf13dd1a%22%5D "Go to definition")**:
   - This method retrieves all the documents from the cursor and converts them into an array. Since this involves fetching data from the database, it is an asynchronous operation and requires [`await`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A35%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%228ca9ee84-f1ec-475d-8834-53d4bf13dd1a%22%5D "Go to definition").

### Correct Code:
```javascript
app.get("/all-books", async (req, res) => {
  const books = booksCollections.find(); // Returns a cursor
  const result = await books.toArray();  // Fetches data and converts to array
  res.send(result);                      // Sends the array as a response
});
```



==============Tutorail 1======================
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows a server to specify which origins (domains) are permitted to access its resources. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent unauthorized access to resources from different origins.

In your code, the [`cors`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e70862f3-7ccc-4b89-8328-a388489206b9%22%5D "Go to definition") middleware is being used to enable CORS for your Express server. By default, browsers block requests made from one origin (e.g., `http://example.com`) to another (e.g., `http://api.example.com`) unless the server explicitly allows it. The [`cors`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fdheeraj757%2FDheeraj%2FProgramms%2Fweb_dev%2FMERN-BOOK-PROJECT%2Fmern-server%2Findex.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e70862f3-7ccc-4b89-8328-a388489206b9%22%5D "Go to definition") package simplifies the process of configuring these permissions.

### Example Use Case:
If your frontend (React) is hosted on `http://localhost:3000` and your backend (Express) is hosted on `http://localhost:5000`, the browser will block requests from the frontend to the backend unless CORS is enabled.

### How It Works in Your Code:
```javascript
app.use(cors());
```
This line enables CORS with default settings, allowing all origins to access your server. You can customize it to restrict access to specific origins or HTTP methods if needed.


The line app.use(express.json()); is a middleware function in an Express.js application. It is used to parse incoming JSON payloads in HTTP request bodies.

Explanation:
express.json() is a built-in middleware in Express (since version 4.16.0).
It parses incoming requests with a Content-Type of application/json and makes the parsed data available in req.body.
Use Case:
When a client sends a JSON payload in the body of a POST, PUT, or PATCH request, this middleware processes the JSON data and converts it into a JavaScript object. Without this middleware, req.body would be undefined.

Example:
If a client sends:

req.body will contain:

Why It's Important:
Without express.json(), you would need to manually parse the JSON payload, which can be cumbersome. This middleware simplifies handling JSON data in your application.


mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.uvafpxf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
The MongoDB URI you provided does not specify a database name. When a database name is not explicitly mentioned in the URI, MongoDB will use the **default database**, which is `test`.
If you want to specify a database name, you can include it in the URI like this:
```properties
mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.uvafpxf.mongodb.net/your_database_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```
Replace `your_database_name` with the name of the database you want to use.
